<p> The goal: </p>
The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agent’s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal.

## About the project
This project was completed at Southern New Hampshire University to learn how to implement algorithms to solve solutions from scratch.

### Scenario
You are working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, you have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agent’s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal.

You have been provided with some starter code and a sample environment where your pirate agent will be placed. You will need to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train your pirate agent. Finally, you have also been asked to write a design defense that demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental AI concepts involved in creating and training your intelligent agent.

## Q&A
### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
In the end, a coder converts requests in normal language into something a computer will understand. Further, a computer scientist will ensure this computer language is efficient, reliable and easy to understand for other computer scientists while also adhering to regulations and rules.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
If I have a problem, I begin by writing down the path at which I took to get to that problem. Instead of trying to go straight to finding a programmable solution, you slow down to think of why the problem occurred in the first place, then you can take steps to find solutions.

### What are your ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As the programmer, I must ensure that any project that I am working on will follow all legal applicable laws such as GDPR and CCPA to ensure that all intellectual and cybersecurity measures are followed.
